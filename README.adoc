= DDD Training

This repository holds a example of a service implementing DDD and CQRS, and is used to get a glimpse into DDD
with CQRS. This example is based on use cases I experienced working on projects in the public austrian social insurance.

== Content of the training

== 1. Design the software

We will talk about the use of DDD and the process necessary when designing a DDD based application.

* How important is ubiquitous language?
* Where to handle state changes?
* To recognize business is important not technologie

== 2. DDD Models

We will discuss the DDD models which are already implement, their usage and why they have been implemented as they are.

* What is an aggregate root
* What is a value model
* state change handling within domain models

=== What we going to implement?

We will implement

. domain methods which handle state changes
. Business validation on state changes
. translator method which translate between representations

== 3. Domain events

We will discuss domain events, why we need them, hoe to implement them, and how to notify registered observers within an Jakarta EE environment.

* What is a domain event for
* Why using domain events
* What data is necessary within a domain event

=== What we going to implement?

We will implement

. Domain events which represent state changes of importance
. the creation and registration of domain events
. the observers of domain events

== 4. Hexagonal architecture

We will discuss the hexagonal architecture and how it play with DDD.

* What is the architecture for
* How to realize such an architecture in an application
* What are the advantages of the hexagonal architecture

== 5. CQRS

We will discuss the segregation of commands and queries and use-cases.

* What is CQRS for
* why segregating commands and queries
* what are use cases for

=== What we going to implement?

We will implement

. Repositories
. Use Cases (CommandHandler and QueryHandler)
. Validators for complex validation of domain models

== Business Rules

=== Leistungsfall

==== Created

. Cannot be created if
** a one already exists with the `Nummer`
** a one already exists for an `VSNR` in state `NEW`.

If one of the rules is broken, then the execution must fail with an exception.

==== State transitions

. Can only be marked `STORNIERT`, when marked as
**  `NEW`
**  `ANWEISUNG_FREIGEGEBEN`
. Can only be marked `ANWEISUNG_FREIGEGEBEN`, when marked as
**  `NEW`
. Can only be marked `ANGEWIESEN`, when marked as
**  `ANWEISUNG_FREIGEGEBEN`
. Can only be marked `ABGELEHNT` with an explanation (at least 50 characters) and when marked as
**  `NEW`
**  `ANWEISUNG_FREIGEGEBEN`
. Must have set `angeiwesenAm` when marked as `ANGEWIESEN`

If one of the rules is broken, then state transition must not take place and the execution must fail with an error.

==== Events

. Must notify about state transition

Each observer must be notified within the transaction.

=== Gesamtleistung

=== Adding Einzelleistungen

. Can only have `5` Einzelleistungen
. Max sum netto is `100.00`
. Max sum brutto is `120.00`

If one of the rules is broken, then the Einzelleistung must not be added but ignored.

==== Events

. Must notify if an invalid Einzelleistung was tried to be added, after the transaction completed.

=== Einzelleistung

. Max netto is `100.00`
. Max MWST is `20.00`

The must not be an instance of Einzelleistung which breaks this rules. If one is tried to be created invalidly, then the execution must fail with
and exception.
